Recent advances in nanomaterials have enabled the development of highly efficient electrodes for energy storage applications. In particular, the incorporation of graphene-based composites into lithium-ion battery cathodes has shown promise for enhanced capacity and cycle life. Despite these improvements, challenges remain in controlling the interfacial stability between the active material and electrolyte under extended cycling. To address this issue, the present study examines the effect of a novel polymer-coated graphene additive on electrode degradation over 500 charge/discharge cycles. Our results demonstrate that the polymer coating significantly reduces capacity fade and mitigates structural collapse of the electrode architecture.
