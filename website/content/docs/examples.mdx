# Examples

## Basic Usage

### Simple Typing

The most basic usage - just type some text:

```bash
typesim
# Choose option 1
# Paste: Hello, world!
# Press Enter
# Switch to app
```

### Typing Code

typesim works great for typing code snippets:

```bash
typesim
# Choose option 1
# Paste:
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello()
# Press Enter
# Switch to code editor
```

## Loading from Files

### Load a Text File

```bash
typesim
# Choose option 3
# Enter: ~/Documents/essay.txt
# Press Enter
# Switch to app
```

### Load Code from File

```bash
typesim
# Choose option 3
# Enter: ~/projects/script.py
# Press Enter
# Switch to editor
```

## Custom Configurations

### Fast Typing

For quick demos or when you're in a hurry:

1. Run `typesim`
2. Choose Settings (option 2)
3. Set Speed Multiplier to `2.0x`
4. Set Base Delay Min/Max to `20-50ms`
5. Go back and start typing

### Slow, Deliberate Typing

For presentations or when you want to emphasize:

1. Run `typesim`
2. Choose Settings (option 2)
3. Set Speed Multiplier to `0.5x`
4. Set Thinking Pause to `500-1500ms`
5. Go back and start typing

### More Typos

For demonstrating error correction:

1. Run `typesim`
2. Choose Settings (option 2)
3. Set Typo Probability to `15%`
4. Go back and start typing

### AI-Powered Rephrasing

For more dynamic text changes:

1. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Run `typesim`
3. Choose Settings (option 2)
4. Enable "Use AI"
5. Set Rephrase Probability to `20%`
6. Go back and start typing

## Using Presets

### Quick Preset Selection

```bash
typesim
# Press 'p' for presets
# Choose: Natural
# Start typing
```

Presets are pre-configured for common use cases.

## Advanced Workflows

### Export and Share Config

Create a custom config and share it:

```bash
typesim
# Configure settings
# Press 'e' to export
# Enter: my-custom-config.yaml
# Share the file with others
```

### Import Team Config

Use a shared configuration:

```bash
typesim
# Press 'i' to import
# Enter: team-config.yaml
# Settings loaded!
```

### Batch Typing Multiple Files

While typesim doesn't support batch mode directly, you can script it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Typing $file..."
    # Manual process: run typesim, load file, type
done
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Code Demo

Demonstrating code typing in a presentation:

1. Configure for natural typing speed
2. Load your code file
3. Start typing into your IDE
4. Use pause/resume to control flow

### Chat Simulation

Making chat messages look more natural:

1. Set moderate typo probability (5-10%)
2. Use natural speed
3. Type into chat application
4. Let typos and corrections happen naturally

### Writing Demo

Showing writing process:

1. Enable higher edit probability (15-20%)
2. Enable rephrasing if AI is available
3. Type into word processor
4. Show natural editing behavior

### Testing Accessibility

Testing keyboard input handling:

1. Use typesim to simulate user input
2. Test how applications handle realistic typing
3. Verify keyboard shortcuts work correctly

## Tips and Tricks

### Countdown Timing

- Use 3-5 seconds countdown for most cases
- Increase if you need more time to switch apps
- Decrease if you're quick at switching

### Speed Control

- Start with default speed (1.0x)
- Adjust during typing with +/- keys
- Faster speeds (1.5x+) for demos
- Slower speeds (0.5x) for emphasis

### Emergency Stop

Always remember: **Esc stops everything immediately**

Useful if:
- You need to stop mid-typing
- Something goes wrong
- You need to switch apps urgently

### File Paths

- Use absolute paths: `/Users/name/file.txt`
- Use tilde expansion: `~/Documents/file.txt`
- Relative paths work from current directory

## Troubleshooting

### Typing Too Fast/Slow

Adjust speed multiplier in settings or use +/- during typing.

### Not Enough Typos

Increase typo probability in settings (try 10-15%).

### Too Many Corrections

Decrease edit probability or typo probability.

### AI Not Working

- Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set
- Verify API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Disable AI if not needed
