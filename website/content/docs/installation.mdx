# Installation

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** - typesim requires Python 3.12 or higher
- **UV** - Modern Python package manager (recommended) or pip

## Quick Install (UV)

The recommended installation method uses UV:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/pc-style/typesim.git
```

This installs typesim globally and makes it available as a command-line tool.

## Development Installation

If you want to install from source or contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pc-style/typesim.git
cd typesim

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Or install in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

typesim uses the following dependencies:

- `pynput` - For keyboard control
- `google-genai` - For Gemini API integration (optional)
- `rich` - For TUI interface
- `pyyaml` - For configuration persistence
- `inquirer` - For interactive prompts

These are automatically installed when you install typesim.

## Gemini API Setup (Optional)

For AI-powered features like smart rephrasing and synonyms:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Or add it to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```bash
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If the Gemini API is unavailable or disabled, typesim falls back to hardcoded alternatives.

## macOS Permissions

On macOS, you may need to grant accessibility permissions for keyboard control:

1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Add your terminal application (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.) to the allowed list
3. Restart your terminal

Without these permissions, typesim won't be able to simulate keyboard input.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify typesim is working:

```bash
typesim --help
# or
uv run typesim
```

You should see the typesim main menu.
