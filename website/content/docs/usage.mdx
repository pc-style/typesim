## Keyboard Shortcuts (During Typing)

While typesim is typing, you can use these shortcuts:

- **+** or **Ctrl+Plus** - Increase typing speed
- **-** or **Ctrl+Minus** - Decrease typing speed
- **Esc** - Stop typing completely

Shortcuts are displayed when typing starts.

## Workflow

### Basic Workflow

1. Run `typesim`
2. Choose option from main menu
3. Enter text (or load from file)
4. Press Enter to start countdown
5. **Switch to your target app** (text editor, chat, etc.)
6. Watch the realistic typing happen!
7. Use keyboard shortcuts to control typing

### Tips

- **Give yourself time**: Use the countdown to switch to your target app
- **Test first**: Try typing into a text editor before using in important applications
- **Adjust speed**: Use the speed controls if typing is too fast or slow
- **Emergency stop**: Press Esc anytime to stop immediately
- **Bypass detection**: The tool's realistic timing and edits help avoid typing-process analyzers like GPTZero
- **Use responsibly**: Always comply with the rules of the platforms where you type

## Loading from Files

typesim can load text from any text file:

```bash
typesim
# Choose option 3
# Enter: /path/to/my/document.txt
