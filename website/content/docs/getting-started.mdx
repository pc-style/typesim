# Getting Started

Welcome to **typesim** — a Python tool that simulates realistic human typing behavior. Specifically designed to bypass typing analysis systems like GPTZero by mimicking authentic human typing patterns. Use it responsibly and follow the rules of the platform where you type.

## What is typesim?

typesim is an AI-powered typing simulator that replicates authentic human typing patterns:

- **Bypass typing analysis systems** — Evade detection by GPTZero and similar tools
- **Realistic typos** with automatic corrections
- **Variable typing speed** with natural pauses and rhythm
- **Mid-sentence edits** and rephrasing
- **AI-powered suggestions** (optional Gemini integration)

## Quick Install

The fastest way to get started is using UV:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/pc-style/typesim.git
```

After installation, you can run typesim from anywhere:

```bash
typesim
```

## First Run

When you first run typesim, you'll see a main menu:

1. **Start Typing** - Enter text and start typing simulation
2. **Settings** - Configure all typing behaviors
3. **Load from File** - Load text from a file
4. **Reset to Defaults** - Reset all settings

Choose option 1 to start typing. You'll be prompted to paste or type your text, then press Enter to start a countdown. During the countdown, switch to your target application (text editor, chat, etc.) and watch the realistic typing happen!

## Basic Usage Example

```bash
# Run typesim
typesim

# Choose option 1 (Start Typing)
# Paste your text
# Press Enter
# Switch to target app during countdown
# Watch the magic happen!
```
